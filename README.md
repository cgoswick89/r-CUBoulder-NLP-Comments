# r-CUBoulder-NLP-Comments
Exploring the raw data of comments left on the r/CUBoulder subreddit for sentiment analysis using BERTopics.

This is a project that was done for class. The goal was to scrape comments from Reddit to better understand the sentiments of students in an forum not moderated by the school.

The data was cleaned to remove unnecessary characters, hate speech, and filler words. 

Then topic modeling was run with Bert Topic Modeling to understand the different topics that were being discussed on Reddit. 

Finally sentiment analysis was performed and two topics, covid and mental health, were chosen to be analyzed in further detail. The comments were highlighted by the positive and negative sentiment in each topic.
